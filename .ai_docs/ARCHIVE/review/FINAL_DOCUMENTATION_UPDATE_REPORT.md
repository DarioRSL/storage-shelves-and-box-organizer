## PART 10: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Settings View Implementation):

1. **Start Settings View Component**
   - Use ready-made API endpoints
   - All PATCH/DELETE workspace endpoints are fully tested
   - No waiting for backend - go ahead and build!

2. **Optional: Add Export & Delete Account UI**
   - Endpoints are already implemented
   - Just need frontend components
   - Can be added while building Settings or deferred

### Medium Term (Post-MVP):

1. **Update README**
   - Add API endpoint status dashboard
   - Show that all endpoints are implemented
   - Encourage frontend teams to use them

2. **Create Integration Tests**
   - Test Settings view with new endpoints
   - Verify cascade deletions work correctly
   - Test export file generation

### Before MVP Launch:

1. **Verify Settings View Integration**
   - Test PATCH workspace name update
   - Test DELETE workspace with confirmation
   - Test optional: DELETE account
   - Test optional: Export inventory

2. **Load Testing**
   - Test export with large workspaces (1000+ boxes)
   - Test cascade delete with complex hierarchies
   - Ensure no timeouts or performance issues
