# Project Coding Guidelines

Follow these guidelines when working on this Storage & Box Organizer project.

## Tech Stack

- Astro 5
- TypeScript 5
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Shadcn/ui

## Clean Code Practices

- Use feedback from linters to improve code when making changes
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling

## Astro Guidelines

- Leverage View Transitions API for smooth page transitions (use ClientRouter)
- Use content collections with type safety for blog posts, documentation, etc.
- Leverage Server Endpoints for API routes
- Use POST, GET - uppercase format for endpoint handlers
- Use `export const prerender = false` for API routes
- Use zod for input validation in API routes
- Extract logic into services in `src/lib/services`
- Implement middleware for request/response modification
- Use image optimization with the Astro Image integration
- Implement hybrid rendering with server-side rendering where needed
- Use Astro.cookies for server-side cookie management
- Leverage import.meta.env for environment variables

## React Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Never use "use client" and other Next.js directives (we use React with Astro)
- Extract logic into custom hooks in `src/components/hooks`
- Implement React.memo() for expensive components that render often with the same props
- Utilize React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and performance optimization
- Use the useCallback hook for event handlers passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Prefer useMemo for expensive calculations to avoid recomputation on every render
- Implement useId() for generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Consider using the new useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates in forms
- Use useTransition for non-urgent state updates to keep the UI responsive

## Frontend Guidelines

### General

- Use Astro components (.astro) for static content and layout
- Implement framework components in React only when interactivity is needed

### Tailwind CSS

- Use the @layer directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Leverage the theme() function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus-visible:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements

### Accessibility (ARIA)

- Use ARIA landmarks to identify regions of the page (main, navigation, search, etc.)
- Apply appropriate ARIA roles to custom interface elements that lack semantic HTML equivalents
- Set aria-expanded and aria-controls for expandable content like accordions and dropdowns
- Use aria-live regions with appropriate politeness settings for dynamic content updates
- Implement aria-hidden to hide decorative or duplicative content from screen readers
- Apply aria-label or aria-labelledby for elements without visible text labels
- Use aria-describedby to associate descriptive text with form inputs or complex elements
- Implement aria-current for indicating the current item in a set, navigation, or process
- Avoid redundant ARIA that duplicates the semantics of native HTML elements

## Backend & Database Guidelines

- Use Supabase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions
- Follow Supabase guidelines for security and performance
- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend
- Use supabase from context.locals in Astro routes instead of importing supabaseClient directly
- Use SupabaseClient type from `src/db/supabase.client.ts`, not from `@supabase/supabase-js`

## Action

Apply these guidelines to all code changes in this project. When writing code, follow the relevant section based on the file type you're working with.
