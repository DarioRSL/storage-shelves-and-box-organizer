## Variable Descriptions

### {PR_SUMMARY}

**Purpose:** High-level overview of what this PR accomplishes

**Format:**

- 1-3 sentences explaining the primary purpose
- Focus on user-facing benefits and business value
- Reference related PRs if this builds on previous work
- Mention completion status (MVP ready, production ready, etc.)

**Examples:**

```markdown
This PR implements the Box Form View, enabling full CRUD operations for box management. Users can now create, edit, and delete boxes with a comprehensive form interface that includes location selection, QR code assignment, and tag management. This completes the core box management functionality following the successful Box Details View from PR #81.
```

```markdown
This PR enhances the Box Form View with critical bug fixes and complete Polish localization. It addresses workspace ID propagation issues preventing location selector from loading, improves navigation UX based on user feedback, and ensures all UI text is in Polish for consistency with the rest of the application.
```

### {KEY_FEATURES_LIST}

**Purpose:** Bulleted list of main features added/changed

**Format:**

- Use `- ` for bullet points
- 3-7 key features (not exhaustive, just highlights)
- Start with action verbs (Add, Implement, Fix, Update, etc.)
- Focus on user-facing or architecturally significant features
- Use Polish UI terms in quotes when referencing interface elements

**Examples:**

```markdown
- ✨ Complete CRUD form for creating and editing boxes
- 📍 Hierarchical location selector with lazy loading
- 🏷️ QR code assignment and management
- 🗑️ Delete functionality with confirmation dialog
- 🌐 Full Polish localization (Utwórz, Zapisz, Anuluj, Wyczyść, Usuń)
- 🔧 Fixed critical workspace ID propagation bug (400 Bad Request → 200 OK)
```

### {CHANGES_OVERVIEW}

**Purpose:** Organize commits by category to show scope of work

**Format:**

```markdown
### Frontend Changes (X commits)

- commit 1: `type(scope): headline`
- commit 2: `type(scope): headline`

### Backend Changes (X commits)

- commit 3: `type(scope): headline`

### Documentation Updates (X commits)

- commit 4: `type(scope): headline`
```

**Guidelines:**

- Group commits by category (Frontend, Backend, Database, Documentation, Tooling)
- Use actual commit headlines (from git log)
- Include commit count per category
- Omit categories with 0 commits
- Order: Database → Backend → Frontend → Documentation → Tooling

**Examples:**

```markdown
### Frontend Bug Fixes (1 commit)

- fix(hooks): correct workspace store reference and expose currentWorkspaceId

### Frontend Enhancements (1 commit)

- feat(ui): enhance Box Form UX with Polish localization and improved navigation

### UI Bug Fixes (1 commit)

### Documentation Updates (3 commits)

- docs(ai_docs): update project tracking with Box Form completion
- docs(review): add comprehensive Box Form View implementation review
- docs(planning): add duplicate box name warning feature plan
```

### {TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE}

**Purpose:** Explain key technical decisions and implementation details

**Format:**

- Subsections for different architectural aspects
- Code snippets for complex patterns
- Explain WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT
- Reference integration points with existing system
- Mention patterns or conventions introduced

**Subsections (use as applicable):**

- **State Management:** Store patterns, data flow
- **API Integration:** Endpoints used, request/response patterns
- **Component Architecture:** Component hierarchy, prop drilling solutions
- **Performance:** Optimization strategies
- **Error Handling:** Error boundary patterns, user feedback
- **Accessibility:** ARIA implementation, keyboard navigation

**Examples:**

```markdown
### State Management

The Box Form uses a custom `useBoxForm` hook that centralizes all form state and API communication:

- **Form state:** Managed with React state (`formData`, `errors`, `loading`)
- **Workspace context:** Retrieved from `@/stores/dashboard` (active workspace store)
- **Location data:** Lazy-loaded via `LocationTree` component on user interaction
- **Optimistic updates:** Form clears on successful create, redirects on save

### Component Hierarchy
```

BoxForm (container)
├── FormHeader
├── FormFields (name, description, tags)
├── LocationSelector
│ └── LocationTree (lazy-loaded hierarchy)
├── QrCodeSelector
└── FormActions (Create/Save, Cancel, Reset, Delete)

```

### Workspace Store Fix
**Problem:** `useBoxForm` was importing from unused `workspace.store.ts` instead of active dashboard store, causing empty `workspace_id` in API requests (400 Bad Request).

**Solution:** Changed to `@/stores/dashboard` and used `useStore` hook from `@nanostores/react` for reactive state access.

**Impact:** Location selector now loads correctly (200 OK instead of 400 Bad Request).
```

### {TESTING_FEEDBACK}

**Purpose:** Document testing performed and user feedback incorporated

**Format:**

```markdown
### Manual Testing Performed

- [ ] Test scenario 1
- [ ] Test scenario 2

### User Feedback Incorporated

> "Original feedback quote in Polish"

- Implementation: Description of how feedback was addressed

### Test Results

- Result 1: Description
- Result 2: Description
```

**Guidelines:**

- Use checkboxes for test scenarios
- Quote user feedback in original language (Polish)
- Explain how feedback influenced implementation
- Include before/after states for bug fixes
- Mention edge cases tested

**Examples:**

```markdown
### Manual Testing Performed

- ✅ Create new box with all fields populated
- ✅ Create box with minimal fields (name only)
- ✅ Edit existing box and save changes
- ✅ Cancel from create mode (redirects to dashboard)
- ✅ Cancel from edit mode (redirects to dashboard)
- ✅ Reset form in create mode (clears fields, stays on page)
- ✅ Delete box with confirmation dialog
- ✅ Location selector loads hierarchical tree (workspace ID fix verified)
- ✅ QR code assignment and unassignment
- ✅ Tag input with comma-separated values
- ✅ Form validation (required name field)

### User Feedback Incorporated

> "Cancel powinien przerwać dodawanie i wrócić do dashboardu"
> (Cancel should abort adding and return to dashboard)

**Implementation:**

- Changed Cancel button behavior to redirect to `/app` dashboard
- Updated both create and edit modes for consistency
- Added Reset button for create mode (clears form, stays on page)
- Users now have clear options: Reset (stay), Cancel (leave), Create/Save (submit and leave)

### Test Results

- **Location selector:** Now loads correctly after workspace store fix
  - Before: 400 Bad Request (empty workspace_id)
  - After: 200 OK (correct workspace_id from dashboard store)
- **Navigation flow:** Matches user expectations
  - Cancel → Dashboard (/app)
  - Create/Save → Dashboard (/app)
  - Reset → Stay on form (create mode only)
```

### {FILES_CHANGED}

**Purpose:** Categorize and count file changes for review context

**Format:**

```markdown
**New Files** ({NEW_FILES_COUNT}):

1. `path/to/file1.tsx` - Description
2. `path/to/file2.md` - Description

**Modified Files** ({MODIFIED_FILES_COUNT}):

1. `path/to/file3.ts` - Changes made
2. `path/to/file4.tsx` - Changes made

**Total Changes**:

- **Lines added:** {LINES_ADDED}
- **Lines removed:** {LINES_REMOVED}
- **Net change:** {NET_CHANGE} lines
```

**Guidelines:**

- Separate new files from modified files
- Use numbered lists for clarity
- Brief description (5-10 words) of each file's role or changes
- Include full relative paths from repo root
- Calculate totals from `git diff --stat`
- Use bold for section headers and metrics

**Examples:**

```markdown
**New Files** (2):

1. `.ai_docs/review/box-form-view-implementation-review.md` - Comprehensive implementation review (376 lines)
2. `.ai_docs/duplicate-name-warning-feature-plan.md` - Feature plan for duplicate box name warnings (850 lines)

**Modified Files** (7):
